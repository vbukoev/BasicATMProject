# BasicATMProject
 In this solution, we will learn how an ATM functions. Just like our daily operations we are implementing the same features in this program, like: deposit cash, withdraw money, check balance.

Firstly, a predefined PIN is initialized in this program(in our "database" which is a list with names, card numbers, and PINS), so that it can be matched with the given (input) PIN number. And then we select the operations given in the program. Based on the selected operation program will work.
